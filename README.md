lua multi hack for Garry's Mod
a little project i've been working on & off for a couple years now
code is clean and easy to read
features: aimbot(silent), hitbox multipoint(customizable), triggerbot(can be standalone or with aimbot), autoreload, wallhack with chams, ESP, entity finder, crosshair, freecam, FOV override, autohop, autostrafe(silent), and a nice looking menu
there are toggles for team checks, within fov checks, and npc checks. the aimbot always aims to the closest target to the crosshair
